                <h2>Why do you need a portfolio?</h2>
                <p>There are many reasons that someone would need a portfolio for their artwork! Take a look at these examples below:</p>
            </section>
            <section class="student">
                <img class="student-portfolio" src="#" alt="#">
                <h2 class="student-text">Art Students</h2>
                <p class="student-text">Are you an art major in college and are working on many projects! An affordable portfolio will be able to showcase those projects with ease and make your final projects look more professional and serious! You can use these to get views and comments on your work while you continue learning and it would help you improve your art through helpful tips from other artists, and boost your motivation from comments!</p>
            </section>
            <section class="freelancers">
                <h2 class="freelancer-text">Freelancers</h2>
                <p class="freelancer-text">Maybe you are a freelancing artist who commissions drawings for people. It would be helpful for your potential customers to get a sense of what your style is and some of the work that you can do. This builds their confidence in you that you could create what they are looking for.</p>
                <img class="freelancer-portfolio" src="#" alt="#">
            </section>
            <section class="passionists">
                <img class="passionist-portfolio" src="#" alt="#">
                <h2 class="passionist-text">Passionate Painters</h2>
                <p class="passionist-text">Maybe you are a painter whose walls are getting overcrowded with your work! No problem, because Dream Portfolio will help you as you work to sell your paintings and then your hard work will finally pay off, and your paintings can still be remembered forever by you and other admirers on your portfolio!</p>
            </section>
            <section class="pricing">
                <h2>Pricing</h2>
                <p>An example pricing of a similar website with their most basic package costs $23 a month, or by electing to pay annually, $192 a year. This isn’t attractive for young artists, especially those who may be just starting out trying to grow their business or reach. Dream Portfolio offers to host portfolios online for the low price of $2 a month, that’s cheaper than a cup of hot chocolate!</p>
