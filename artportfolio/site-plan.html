      <h3>Home page</h3>
      <p>
        <br> <b>Purpose</b> <br>
        Dream Portfolios Website is designed to assist customers in a few different ways. One, is to help artists create a custom portfolio for their artwork so that they could use it for projects or advertisement, and another purpose for the website is for customers to browse artist’s portfolios and see their artwork.
        
        <br> <b>User Activity</b> <br>
        Art browsing will be a big part of the website. Each artist can have a page to display their art and each of those pages will be visible to the public internet! Artists will be able to customize their portfolio how they please and list their paintings and art for sale. Customers could also use the website to get in contact with these artists to buy their artwork.

        <br> <b>The “Why”</b> <br>
        Part of my plan to make my website enticing to users and artists is because it is hard for artists to find a good way to display their artwork in a professional manner, but in an affordable way! Not everyone knows how to make a website and nobody wants to pay large fees or subscriptions to have someone else do it for them. I plan to make my pricing competitively low because my focus isn’t to make money, but to rather help artists grow!

      <h3>Plans and Pricing</h3>
      <p>
        <br> <b>Why you should get a portfolio! Art Students:</b> <br>
        Why do you need a portfolio? There are many reasons that someone would need a portfolio for their artwork. Maybe you are an art major in college and are working on many projects! An affordable portfolio will be able to showcase those projects with ease and make your final projects look more professional and serious! You can use these to get views and comments on your work while you continue learning and it would help you improve your art through helpful tips from other artists, and boost your motivation from comments!

        <br> <b>Freelancer Artists</b> <br>
        Maybe you are a freelancing artist who commissions drawings for people. It would be helpful for your potential customers to get a sense of what your style is and some of the work that you can do. This builds their confidence in you that you could create what they are looking for.

        <br> <b>Passionate Painters</b> <br>
        Maybe you are a painter whose walls are getting overcrowded with your work! No problem, because Dream Portfolio will help you as you work to sell your paintings and then your hard work will finally pay off, and your paintings can still be remembered forever by you and other admirers on your portfolio!

        <br> <b>Example Pricing</b> <br>
        An example pricing of a similar website with their most basic package costs $23 a month, or by electing to pay annually, $192 a year. This isn’t attractive for young artists, especially those who may be just starting out trying to grow their business or reach. Dream Portfolio offers to host portfolios online for the low price of $2 a month, that’s cheaper than a cup of hot chocolate!
